##From pulling an all nighter my freshman year (DO NOT RECOMMEND), to turning papers in with less than a minute left to spare (something I am quite proud of actually), to writing a 51 page Senior Thesis, I have had my fair share of academic stress.

###As we can see in the graph to the right, hanging out with friends does not have a relationship with academic stress. I believe that this is caused by a combination of all three factors mentioned in the previous slide.

#How about sleep?
<br>
##Based on the [interconnected relationship](https://www.sleep.org/sleep-and-stress/) between sleep and stress, I would expect students who get appropriate levels of sleep would have the least amount of stress.

###Long story short, if you want less stress, get seven hours of sleep.
<br>
I believe that part of this is because it finds the perfect balance of enough sleep and time to do stuff. Part of the reason students who get 5-6 hours of sleep are more stressed is because they are getting so little sleep but also because they probably have a lot of homework that is taking away from sleep. As for students who get 8-10 hours it is possible that this is too much sleep and they do not have enough time to get their work done along with everything else they want to do.

#What about exercise? 
<br>
##Well, given the fact that it has been proven that exercising helps alleviate [mental stress](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercising-to-relax), I would expect students who report getting some exercise in would have the lowest levels of academic stress.

###Looking at the graph to the right, 
###we can see that exercising does in fact decrease stress. 
<br>
####Students who report 
####getting 1-2 hours of exercise  every day report the least amount of stress. However, once students start getting 3+ hours, stress spikes. This 
####is likely driven by having too little time to finish assingments on time
